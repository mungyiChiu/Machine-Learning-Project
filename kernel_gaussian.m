function K = kernel_gaussian(X, X2, sigma)
% Evaluates the Gaussian Kernel with specified sigma
%
% Usage:
%
%    K = KERNEL_GAUSSIAN(X, X2, SIGMA)
%
% For a N x D matrix X and a M x D matrix X2, computes a M x N kernel
% matrix K where K(i,j) = k(X(i,:), X2(j,:)) and k is the Guassian kernel
% with parameter sigma=20.

n = size(X,1);
m = size(X2,1);
K = zeros(m, n);

% HINT: Transpose the sparse data matrix X, so that you can operate over columns. Sparse
% column operations in matlab are MUCH faster than row operations.

% YOUR CODE GOES HERE.
a=X2';
b=X';

for i = 1 : m
    for j = 1 : n
        K(i,j)=exp(-norm(a(:,i)-b(:,j))^2/(2*sigma^2));
    end
